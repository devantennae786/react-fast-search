When using server side rendering, instead of having your browser download a minimal HTML page that JavaScript will fill, the initial content is generated on the server. Then, the browser will download a page with the HTML content already in place. 

Usually server side rendering is considered to improve SEO and performances. 

The [Server-side rendering guide](guide/Server-side_rendering.html) explains in details how you can use Server Side Rendering with React InstantSearch.
