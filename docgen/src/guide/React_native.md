React InstantSearch is compatible with [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/)

There are no widgets for now but it's very easy to do an app using our [connectors](guide/Connectors.html)

You can follow our [getting started tutorial](Getting_started_React_native.html) or check out our [more advanced React Native example](https://github.com/algolia/react-instantsearch/tree/master/packages/react-instantsearch/examples/react-native) linking `react-instantsearch` to [react-native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/). You can also simply [launch the example on your phone](https://expo.io/@mlthuret/algolia-react-instantsearch) by using the Expo client. 

Also here are the React InstantSearch concepts you should master in order to build your mobile application:

* [The connectors](guide/Connectors.html)
* [Sharing the state between several InstantSearch instances](guide/Routing.html)
* [Virtual Widgets](guide/Virtual_widgets.html)

<div class="guide-nav">
    <div class="guide-nav-left">
        Previous: <a href="guide/Conditional_display.html">← Conditional Display</a>
    </div>
    <div class="guide-nav-right">
        Next: <a href="guide/Server-side_rendering.html">Server-side rendering →</a>
    </div>
</div>
