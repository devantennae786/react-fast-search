This example shows how to use an external autocomplete component with `react-instantsearch`
It uses [react-autosuggest](https://github.com/moroshko/react-autosuggest) as the autocomplete external component.

You will find two use cases:

* How to build an autocomplete displaying hits from different indices
* How to build @-mentions using [ant](https://ant.design) as the external component

To start the example:

```sh
yarn install --no-lockfile
yarn start
```
